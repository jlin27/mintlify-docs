### Query Parameters
<ParamField path="chainId" type="integer" required>
Chain ID. See [here](https://0x.org/docs/developer-resources/supported-chains) for the list of supported chains
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="buyToken" type="string" required>
The contract address of the token to buy
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="sellToken" type="string" required>
The contract address of the token to sell
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="sellAmount" type="string" required>
The amount of `sellToken` in `sellToken` base units to sell
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="taker" type="string">
The address which holds the `sellToken` balance and has the allowance set for the swap
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="txOrigin" type="string">
The address of the external account that started the transaction. This is only needed if `taker` is a smart contract.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="recipient" type="string">
The address to receive the `buyToken`. If not provided, defaults to the taker address.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="swapFeeRecipient" type="string">
The wallet address to receive the specified trading fees. You must also specify the `swapFeeToken` and `swapFeeBps` in the request to use this feature. Learn more about setting up a trading fee/commission in the FAQs
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="swapFeeBps" type="integer">
The amount in Bps of the `swapFeeToken` to charge and deliver to the `swapFeeRecipient`. You must also specify the `swapFeeRecipient` and `swapFeeToken` in the request to use this feature. For security, this field has a default limit of 1000 Bps. If your application requires a higher value, please reach out to us.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="swapFeeToken" type="string">
The contract address of the token to receive trading fees in. This must be set to the value of either the `buyToken` or the `sellToken`. You must also specify the `swapFeeRecipient` and `swapFeeBps` in the request to use this feature
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="tradeSurplusRecipient" type="string">
The address to receive any trade surplus. If specified, this address will receive trade surplus when applicable. Otherwise, the taker will receive the surplus. This feature is only available to selected integrators on a custom pricing plan. In other cases, the surplus will be collected by 0x. For assistance with a custom plan, please contact support.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="gasPrice" type="string">
The target gas price (in wei) for the swap transaction. If not provided, the default value is based on the 0x gas price oracle
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="slippageBps" type="integer">
The maximum acceptable slippage of the `buyToken` in Bps. If this parameter is set to 0, no slippage will be tolerated. If not provided, the default slippage tolerance is 100Bps
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="excludedSources" type="string">
Liquidity sources e.g. Uniswap_V3, SushiSwap, 0x_RFQ to exclude from the provided quote. See [https://api.0x.org/sources?chainId=](https://api.0x.org/sources?chainId=) with the desired chain's ID for a full list of sources. Separate multiple sources with a comma
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="sellEntireBalance" type="string">
If set to `true`, the taker's entire `sellToken` balance will be sold during trade execution. The `sellAmount` should be the maximum estimated value, as close as possible to the actual taker's balance to ensure the best routing. Selling more than the `sellAmount` may cause the trade to revert. This feature is designed for cases where the precise sell amount is determined during execution. Learn more [here](https://0x.org/docs/0x-swap-api/advanced-topics/sell-entire-balance).

## Responses

### 200
Success

<Expandable title="Response body">
<ResponseField name="allowanceTarget" type="string" required>
The target contract address for which the `taker` needs to have an allowance in order to be able to complete the swap. For swaps with the native asset (ie "ETH" or "BNB") as the `sellToken`, wrapping the native asset (i.e. "ETH" to "WETH") or unwrapping, no allowance is needed
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="blockNumber" type="string" required>
The block number at which the liquidity sources were sampled to generate the quote. This indicates the freshness of the quote
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="buyAmount" type="string" required>
The amount of `buyToken` (in `buyToken` units) that will be bought in the swap
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="buyToken" type="string" required>
The contract address of the token to buy in the swap
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="fees" type="object" required>
Fees to be deducted in this transaction. It contains the `integratorFee`, `zeroExFee` and `gasFee`

<ResponseField name="gas" type="string" required>
The estimated gas limit that should be used to send the transaction to guarantee settlement
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="gasPrice" type="string" required>
The gas price (in wei) that should be used to send the transaction. The transaction needs to be sent with this `gasPrice` for the transaction to be successful
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="issues" type="object" required>
An object containing potential issues discovered during 0x validation that can prevent the swap from being executed successfully by the `taker`
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="liquidityAvailable" type="boolean" required>
This validates the availability of liquidity for the quote requested. The rest of the fields will only be returned if `true`
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="minBuyAmount" type="string" required>
The price which must be met or else the entire transaction will revert. This price is influenced by the `slippageBps` parameter. On-chain sources may encounter price movements from quote to settlement
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="path" type="object" required>
The path of liquidity sources to be used in executing this swap
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="sellAmount" type="string" required>
