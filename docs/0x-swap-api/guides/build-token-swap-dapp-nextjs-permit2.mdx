title: Build a Token Swap App (Permit2)
---

_Advanced guide covering how to build a token swap app using 0x Swap API (Permit2)._

<Warning>

⚠️ The **Permit2** flow is intended for **advanced integrators only**.

If you're new to 0x Swap API or want to avoid the double-signature UX, consider using [AllowanceHolder](/0x-swap-api/guides/build-token-swap-dapp-nextjs) instead.

</Warning>

This guide walks through a Next.js demo app that demonstrates a full token swap flow using Permit2, designed for advanced integrators who are comfortable handling EIP-712 signatures and advanced token approvals.

This guide is intended for advanced integrators only. If you are new to Swap API or want to avoid the double-signature flow, we recommend using the Swap API [AllowanceHolder](/0x-swap-api/guides/build-token-swap-dapp-nextjs) flow.

## What we will build

This app demonstrates principles used in production swapping apps such as [Matcha.xyz](https://matcha.xyz/):

- Fetch indicative prices via `/swap/permit2/price`
- Get firm quotes via `/swap/permit2/quote`
- Approve token allowances using Permit2
- Sign Permit2 EIP-712 messages and submit transactions

## Pre-requisites

You should be familiar with:

- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/)
- [viem](https://viem.sh/)
- Swap API concepts ([intro](../introduction) or [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APXjSGLaoRw))

We’ll build this app on the [Base](https://www.base.org/) network, but it can be adapted to any Swap API-[supported chains](/docs/introduction/supported-chains).

## Core Concepts

To build our swap app, we’ll focus on:

- 🌈 RainbowKit
- 🏷 PriceView
- 💸 QuoteView
- 🪙 Token lists

### What is it?

These components are transferable to almost any token swapping app being built.

![Swap v2 dApp Core Concepts](/docs/static/img/0x-swap-api/swap-v2-core-concepts.png)

## 🌈 RainbowKit

### What is it?

[RainbowKit](https://www.rainbowkit.com/) is a React library that makes it easy to add wallet connection to your app. We are using their [Next.js App Router example](https://www.rainbowkit.com/docs/installation#further-examples) in our app.

Check out their [installation instructions](https://www.rainbowkit.com/docs/installation) to understand the configurations. You can [configure](https://www.rainbowkit.com/docs/installation#configure) your desired chains and generate the required connectors.

### Code

#### Setup WalletConnect `projectId` in providers.tsx

RainbowKit relies on WalletConnect. Obtain a free `projectId` from [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/app) and replace the key in the `.env` file.

```typescript
// Inside /swap-v2-next-app/.env
# To get a RainbowKit relies on WalletConnect, get a free projectId here:
# https://cloud.walletconnect.com/app
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID="ADD_YOUR_KEY"
```

```typescript
// Inside /app/providers/tsx
const projectId = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID as string; // Uses your free key setup in .env
```

## 🏷 PriceView

### What is it?

This component is for users to browse for a price without committing to a trade, aka, get the indicative price. An indicative price is used when users just want to check the price they could receive on a trade, for this we will use the [/swap/permit2/price](/api#tag/Swap/operation/swap::permit2::getPrice) endpoint.

Later on in the QuoteView, when a user is actually ready to make a trade, the app will ping [/swap/permit2/quote](/api#tag/Swap/operation/swap::permit2::getQuote) which returns an order that is ready to submitted on-chain.

This is also important because `/quote` returns back an order in which a Market Maker must commit their assets to settle that trade. So if we ping `/quote` too much when we really are just asking for a price and not ready to submit an order, then this can clog up the system!

### UI/UX Walk-through

And if we look through the UI, here are some notable things to callout:

- User selects **sell** and **buy tokens** from the token selectors
- Users inputs a **sellAmount**
- Users can **“Connect Wallet”** powered by RainbowKit
- Whenever sellAmount changes, the **app fetches a price** even if a wallet is not connect
- Displays returned **buyAmount**
- When users find a price they like, they can connect their wallet, and switch to the correct network (e.g. Base), the button now says **"Approve** if the user has enough of the sell token
  - The Approval button allows users to set a token allowance
  - This is standard practice when users need to give a token allowance for a third-party to move funds on our behalf, in this case the Permit2 contract, to trade the user’s ERC20 tokens on their behalf.
  - Users can set an amount they are comfortable with, the default we’ve set is a really big number, but they can also choose only the amount they have in their wallet
- When we are happy with this trade, our approve button is now **“Review Trade** because we already approved the token allowance, so we can move forward

![](/docs/static/img/0x-swap-api/swap-demo-price-view.gif)

### Code

The code for this component lives in [/app/components/price.tsx](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-examples/blob/main/swap-v2-next-app/app/components/price.tsx). The logic for when the component appears in UI is in [/app/page.tsx](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-examples/blob/main/swap-v2-next-app/app/page.tsx#L22-L44), it is displayed if the user has not clicked "Review Trade" to finalize the price.

#### Fetch price with /swap/permit2/price

The price is fetched using [/swap/permit2/price](/api#tag/Swap/operation/swap::permit2::getPrice). This API request is wrapped behind [/app/api/price/route.ts](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-examples/blob/main/swap-v2-next-app/app/api/price/route.ts) and triggered in the UI by `useEffect` here in [/app/components/price.tsx](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-examples/blob/main/swap-v2-next-app/app/components/price.tsx#L91-L135)

Wrapping our API key protects it because all API requests are viewable by if someone inspects the browser, but we don’t want them inspecting an finding our keys. Instead, when the user queries for an indicative price, it pings our API setup in [/app/api/price/route.ts](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-examples/blob/main/swap-v2-next-app/app/api/price/route.ts) and that pings the Swap API using our API key in the header.

This example uses a demo key which should not be used in production or outside of this demo; however, you can get your own key by going from the 0x Dashboard and following the [Getting Started guide](https://0x.org/docs/introduction/getting-started).

In addition, we use Next.js App Router's built-in data fetching pattern and the [useEffect](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect) hook to make the request. By using [useEffect](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect), we will get a stream of data updates constantly and automatically, and the UI will quickly respond to any changes, such as when the user inputs a new `sellAmount`.

#### Token Allowances & Approvals

<Danger>

Important: Read Before Using 0x API

- NEVER set an allowance on the [Settler contract](/introduction/0x-cheat-sheet#0x-settler-contracts). Doing so may result in unintended consequences, including potential loss of tokens or exposure to security risks. The Settler contract does not support or require token allowances for its operation. Setting an allowance on the Settler contract will lead to misuse by other parties.

- ONLY set allowances on [AllowanceHolder](/introduction/0x-cheat-sheet#allowanceholder-contract) or [Permit2](/introduction/0x-cheat-sheet#permit2-contract) contracts, as indicated by the API responses.

- The correct allowance target is returned in `issues.allowance.spender` or `allowanceTarget`.

</Danger>

Before placing a trade on the PageView, users must set allowances on all tokens involved. A token allowance lets a third party move funds on your behalf. Essentially, you permit them to move your tokens.

In our case, we want to approve an allowance for Permit2 contract to trade our ERC20 tokens for us. To do this, we need to approve a specific allowance, allowing this contract to move a certain amount of our ERC20 tokens on our behalf. Read more about [token allowances](../advanced-topics/how-to-set-your-token-allowances)

![token allowance ui](/docs/static/img/0x-swap-api/token-allowance-ui.png)

The logic to check if the user has approved a token allowance the selected sell token is setup [here](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-examples/blob/main/swap-v2-next-app/app/components/price.tsx#L451-L482).

1. First, we need to check if the spender (Permit2) has an allowance already. We can use wagmi's [useReadContract()](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-examples/blob/main/swap-v2-next-app/app/components/price.tsx#L463-L476) hook to read from the sellToken's "allowance" function.
2. If there is no allowance, then we will write an approval to the sellToken's smart contract using wagmi's [useSimulateContract() and useWriteContract()](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-examples/blob/main/swap-v2-next-app/app/components/price.tsx#L463-L476).
3. Lastly, use wagmi's [useWaitForTransactionReceipt()](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-examples/blob/main/swap-v2-next-app/app/components/price.tsx#L416-L420) to wait for the approval transaction to complete

<Tip>
  Be aware that approvals cost gas. _Looking for a gasless approach? Check out
  [Gasless API](../../gasless-api/introduction)._
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Need to quickly revoke an allowance while testing? To revoke an allowance, you
  can set the allowance to 0. This can be done programmatically or through a UI
  such as https://revoke.cash/ .
</Tip>

## 💸 QuoteView

### What is it?

The QuoteView component provides users with an overview of the transaction details before executing the token swap. Earlier in the PriceView, we provided users an indicative price because they were just browsing for pricing information, so did not need a full 0x order. On the QuoteView, users are ready to fill the order, so we need to provide them a firm quote, and the Market Makers can know to reserve the proper assets to settle the trade.

![swap demo quoteview](/docs/static/img/0x-swap-api/swap-demo-quoteview-affiliate-fee.png)

### UI/UX Walk-through

- Displays the **sell** and **buy Amounts** that the user pays and receives, respectively
  - I’ve formatted it but you can get the symbols, decimal points for formatting from the token list. The amounts are the buy and sell Amounts returned from the quote
- From here, the user can **“Place Order”** which creates, signs, and sends a new transaction to the network.

### Code

The code for this component lives in [/app/components/quote.tsx](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-examples/blob/main/swap-v2-next-app/app/components/quote.tsx). The logic for when the component appears in UI is in [/app/page.tsx](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-examples/blob/main/swap-v2-next-app/app/page.tsx#L22-L43), it is displayed if the user has approved the token allowance, and clicked "Review Trade" to finalize the trade selection.

#### Fetch quote with /swap/permit2/quote

Pinging [`/swap/permit2/quote`](/api#tag/Swap/operation/swap::permit2::getQuote) is wrapped behind [`/app/api/quote/route.ts`](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-examples/blob/main/swap-v2-next-app/app/api/quote/route.ts), which is triggered by the [`useEffect`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect) hook here in [/app/component/quote.tsx](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-examples/blob/main/swap-v2-next-app/app/components/quote.tsx#L53-L82), similar to what we did for PriceView.

#### Sign the Permit2 EIP-712 message

Before submitting the quote order to the blockchain, we need to sign the `permit2.eip712` object from our quote response. [Code here](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-examples/blob/main/swap-v2-next-app/app/components/quote.tsx#L192-L201).

```javascript
// sign permit2.eip712 returned from quote

let signature: Hex;
signature = await signTypedDataAsync(quote.permit2.eip712);
```

#### Append signature length and signature data to transaction.data

Next, append the signature length and signature data to `transaction.data`. [Code here](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-examples/blob/main/swap-v2-next-app/app/components/quote.tsx#L202-L222).

The format should be `<sig len><sig data>`, where:

- `<sig len>`: 32-byte unsigned big-endian integer representing the length of the signature
- `<sig data>`: The actual signature data

```js
import { concat, numberToHex, size } from "viem";

const signatureLengthInHex = numberToHex(size(signature), {
  signed: false,
  size: 32,
});
quote.transaction.data = concat([
  transaction.data,
  signatureLengthInHex,
  signature,
]);
```

#### Submit the transaction to the network

The last step is to submit the transaction with all the required parameters using your preferred web3 library (e.g. wagmi, viem, ethers.js, web3.js). In this example, we use wagmi's [useSendTransaction](https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useSendTransaction).

Pass the required params we get from the quote response to `sendTransaction`. [Code here](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-examples/blob/main/swap-v2-next-app/app/components/quote.tsx#L224-L240).

```javascript
sendTransaction({
  account: walletClient?.account.address,
  gas: !!quote?.transaction.gas ? BigInt(quote?.transaction.gas) : undefined,
  to: quote?.transaction.to,
  data: quote?.transaction.data,
  chainId: chainId,
});
```

## 🪙 Token lists

### What is it?

Token Lists allow users to select their desired tokens for swapping. For ERC20 tokens, these lists typically include crucial metadata - such as the token names (Wrapped Ether), symbol (ETH), address, and logoURI - which can be leveraged by apps such as ours.

Thankfully there are several established sources that curate and open-source this information. As developers, we can choose to ingest the entire list or customize our own token lists based off of these sources.

### Notable lists

- Trust Wallet: https://github.com/trustwallet/assets/tree/master/blockchains
- Polygon Assets github: https://github.com/maticnetwork/polygon-token-assets/tree/main/assets/tokenAssets
- Tokenlists: https://tokenlists.org/
- Coin Gecko: https://tokenlists.org/token-list?url=https://tokens.coingecko.com/uniswap/all.json

### Code

In our demo, we curated a token list in [`/src/constants.ts`](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-examples/blob/main/swap-v2-next-app/src/constants.ts). In production level apps, it's common practice to maintain a token list since some apps don't support _all_ available tokens.

## Monetize your swap integration

And as your business grows, Swap API offers low-friction ways to monetize your products.

Web3 teams can leverage Swap API to unlock new revenue streams by easily tapping into affiliate fee and trade surplus features. Regardless of whether you’re on a [free or paid plan](https://0x.org/pricing), monetization options are available to all integrators.

Swap API offers two monetization options out-of-the-box:

- Collect affiliate fees (i.e. trading fee or commission) ← shown in this demo app
- Collect trade surplus <sup>1</sup> (i.e. positive slippage)

For more details about monetizing, check out the [How to monetize your app using 0x Swap API](./monetize-your-app-using-swap) guide which discusses pricing considerations and shows code samples for how to easily implement these options.

<sup>1</sup> Trade surplus is available only to select integrators on a custom pricing
plan. For assistance with setting up a custom plan, please contact support.
