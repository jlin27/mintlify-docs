## Using Trade Analytics API

To start using the Trade Analytics API, use the [getSwapTrades](/api-reference/trade-analytics/getswaptrades) and [getGaslessTrades](/api-reference/trade-analytics/getgaslesstrades) functions. Requests to the Trade Analytics APIs require a `0x-api-key`. Data will be returned for the app associated with API key in the request.

## Data

### Data Freshness & Finality

The API updates with new settled trades roughly every 15 minutes. This data is however only considered final 48 hours after the trade is completed. This 48-hour finalization period accounts for potential latency from external providers, like token price sources, ensuring data accuracy and quality.

To ensure that your trading data is up to date, we recommend that you fetch and update data from the preceding 2 days in addition to the current day.

For downtime updates, you can track and subscribe [here](https://0x.statuspal.io/).

### USD Values

The API provides USD estimates for transaction volume and the fees generated from the swap. These values are based on an estimate of the token price at the time of the trade.
