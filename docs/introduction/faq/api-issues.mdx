# Handling API Issues and Error Codes

When working with the 0x API v2, there are two key places to check for errors:

1. [**The `issues` object**](/docs/introduction/faq/api-issues#issues-object): This is returned in the API response when there are validation issues with a quote. It helps identify problems such as insufficient token allowance, low balances, or invalid liquidity sources that could prevent a successful swap execution.
2. [**Error codes**](/docs/introduction/faq/api-issues#error-codes): These are returned when there is an issue making the API request itself, such as invalid input or authorization errors.

---

## Issues Object

By examining both the [`issues` object](/api-reference/swap/getquote-allowance-holder#response-issues) for quote validation and the error codes for request failures, developers can troubleshoot and resolve issues more efficiently, ensuring smoother transaction processes.

In rare cases where 0x cannot fully validate a quote, the API returns `true` in `issues.simulationIncomplete`. Developers are encouraged to check and address these issues before proceeding with the swap.

```json
// Sample response from /swap/permit2/quote with an issues object
{
  "issues": {
    "allowance": {
      "actual": "0",
      "spender": "0x000000000022d473030f116ddee9f6b43ac78ba3"
    },
    "balance": {
      "token": "0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48",
      "actual": "0",
      "expected": "100000000"
    },
    "simulationIncomplete": false,
    "invalidSourcesPassed": []
  }
}
```

### Issue Types and Resolutions

Below is a list of the common issues that may arise when using the `/price` or `/quote` endpoints, along with their causes and resolutions:

| **Issue**                  | **Reason**                                                                         | **Details**                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`allowance`**            | The `taker` does not have sufficient token allowance to execute the swap.          | The response provides the current and required allowance details. Prompt the user to set the correct token allowance.          |
| **`balance`**              | The `taker` does not have enough of the `sellToken` to complete the swap.          | The response provides the actual and expected balances. Advise the user to ensure they have enough tokens to perform the swap. |
| **`simulationIncomplete`** | 0x cannot fully validate the transaction, often due to insufficient balance.       | This doesn’t guarantee the swap will fail. Investigate if the user’s balance is low or if other conditions prevent validation. |
| **`invalidSourcesPassed`** | One or more invalid liquidity sources were included in the `excludedSources` list. | The response provides invalid sources. Remove invalid sources or check the valid list using `GET /sources`.                    |

This table format provides a concise and structured way to convey the relevant information about each issue, helping developers quickly understand the cause and resolution for each one.

### Best Practices for Handling Issues

#### Price Requests

- **`allowance`**: If returned, prompt the user to set the appropriate token allowance before proceeding.
- **`balance`**: Avoid proceeding to the quote stage if the user does not have enough tokens, as indicated by this field.
- **`simulationIncomplete`**: Safe to ignore for price requests. This issue may arise if the `taker` address is set but has an insufficient token balance.

#### Quote Requests

- **`allowance`**: Ensure that users complete the allowance setup before proceeding.
- **`balance`**: This field indicates insufficient token balance; prompt the user to check their balance and retry.
- **`simulationIncomplete`**: Advise users that validation could not be completed, but the trade may still succeed.

## Error Codes

In addition to the `issues` object, the API may return specific error codes under certain conditions. If the error persists, please [contact support](https://help.0x.org/en/articles/8230055-how-to-get-support-from-the-0x-team) for assistance.
