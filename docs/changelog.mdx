<Update label="2024-08-28">
	#### New Features

    - **Buy/Sell Tax Support**: Added support for Fee-on-Transfer tokens, which are subject to buy/sell taxes.

Additionally, the buy and sell tax are now returned, allowing users to utilize this information as needed.
    - **Smart Contract Wallet Support**: Added support for Smart Contract Wallets in Swap API v2's Permit2 flow.
    - **Gas Optimization**: Implemented gas optimizations for Solidly V3 integration.
