## Why migrate to v2?

Upgrading to API v2 ensures your integration stays competitive and unlocks significant benefits:

1. **Access New Features**  
   API v2 introduces cutting-edge enhancements, including advanced quote validation, buy/sell tax support, Permit2 support, additional monetization controls, and more. With continuous reinvestment in v2, staying on v1 means missing out on new features and benefits.

2. **Achieve Better Pricing**  
   Get the most competitive prices using our next-generation pricing engine with multi-hop and multi-plex routing.

3. **Expand to New Chains**  
   Access 5+ additional chains and new liquidity sources, broadening your reach across the ecosystem.
