# 0x Order Types

An order is a message passed into the 0x Settler to facilitate a trade (see [How does 0x work?](./introduction-to-0x#how-does-0x-work)). The order types that we support include:

| Limit Orders   | These are the standard 0x Order, which encodes a possible trade between a maker and taker at a fixed price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [Limit Order Structure](/0x-limit-orders/docs/limit-order-structure)                       | ERC20 ↔ ERC20 trade             |
| RFQ Orders     | These are a stripped down version of standard limit orders, supporting fewer fields and a leaner settlement process. These orders are fielded just-in-time, directly from market makers, during the construction of a swap quote on 0x API, and can be filled through the `fillRfqOrder()` function on the Exchange Proxy. | [RFQ Order Structure](https://docs.0xprotocol.org/en/latest/basics/orders.html#rfq-orders) | ERC20 ↔ ERC20 trade             |
